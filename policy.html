Introduction

We respect intellectual property rights and the owners of such rights.

We will respond to allegations of copyright violations on our services in accordance with applicable law. This Policy sets out how we respond to such alleged copyright infringement, and is incorporated into the Terms of Service which you have agreed to in order to use our services. Any terms used in this Policy will have the same meaning as the equivalent defined terms in the Terms of Service, unless otherwise defined in this Policy or the context requires otherwise.

Scope of this Policy

Please note that this Policy is in relation to alleged copyright infringement only. If you are concerned about alleged infringement of any other types of intellectual property rights (for instance, trademarks) or any other alleged activities that breach the Terms of Service or Acceptable Use Policy, please contact us at feedback@tran-song.com.

Summary

We will, if we receive a valid notification (the “Notification”), remove the relevant allegedly infringing content (the “Content”) from our service. We will then take reasonable steps to contact the Content’s owner; if such owner files a valid counter-notification (the “Counter-Notification”), we will generally restore the Content within 21 days, unless the Notification provider has filed a legal action to keep the Content offline.

Please note that we may provide copies of all such Notifications or Counter-Notifications to any person, where required by law or as otherwise reasonably required by us to protect our interests.

Don’t make false submissions!

Please carefully consider any submission of a Notification or Counter-Notification, particularly if you are unsure whether you own (or are lawfully authorised to use) the relevant Content – we recommend contacting an attorney if this is the case. You may be subject to liability under law if you, in relation to a Notification or Counter-Notification: (i) knowingly make a false submission, or (ii) make a submission in bad faith.
